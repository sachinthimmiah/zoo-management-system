<p class="text"> Best time to visit in the morning.less crowded.a very nice well maintained zoo.the animals are in the open.you can spend 2-3hours easy.lots of toilets and snack places. Best cup of coffee I had there..no food.no candy etc allowed inside.it is for the best as public create a mess.good rule..downside is far from the metro pragati maidan (supreme court) metro.so one has to fight with the auto guys who charge anything from 30-50rs one way.

<p class="text">  The zoo was completely clean and well maintained. I saw animals like Tiger, Lion, jackals, crocodiles, cheetah, deer, elephants, various types of birds and many more. I went in a cool weather which made the place look more attractive. Animals are being taken care properly by the authorities. Inside there are places to have ice cream, tea or coffee. The place is worth visiting for wildlife lovers.

<p class="text"> When I visited this zoo in Feb -2014 with my wife, I wrote here that everyone should take their kids to this place.I was fortunate enough to be able to take my 5 year old daughter in Feb-2020.The zoo is still the same with all kids of animals. I find this as one of the best zoos in the country. The primary attractions are the White Tiger,Bengal Tiger and African Elephant. There was Asiatic Lion too.The zoo just needs an African Lion to make it more attractive.

<p class="text">  Last time I visited the zoo when I was a teenager (some 20 years ago). And it is nothing like that now. We went there last weekend (saturday). And I was totally blown away by the clean, green and serene area of the campus. With clear directions and maps at multiple places it felt like a treasure hunt adventure. Leopards (such a big tail), hornbill (can’t imagine the size of this bird if you haven’t seen it), brazilian blue/green parrots (nature at its best!), baboon (the one in the lion king movie) and the rhinos (dinosaur size) made the trip memorable. The reptile section was closed (really sad!) as they were in hibernation. Overall, a must visit!

<p class="text"> Visited this place in March 2022, impressed with the facilities - be it the cleanliness, the washrooms across the zoo or the travel arrangement inside the zoo. There are electric golf cart (buggies) available for a small ticket. These take you to allocated spots in the zoo from where you can walk and see a few animals and come back to the buggy.
As for the Animals - the same as you can expect the Animals in captivity, not in bad conditions but the sheer liveliness of the jungle is missing. Having said that great place to visit with kids. Time required around 3 hours.
